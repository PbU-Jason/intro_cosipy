## Compton-sphere detector response

Created from Andreas' RSP file in the sftp folder.

Spherical Compton telescope which can be used for testing and debugging analysis algorithms.

Its advantages include:
- 4-pi, flat field of view
- high photo-peak efficiency up to 10 MeV 
- revan-only DEE
- no need for time bins during analysis
- no event selections on Earth horizon, Compton-scatter angle, etc. required
